# Coding Style 

This project adheres to the [pep8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) style guide for 
python code. Additionally all docstrings follow the numpy docstring style guide. 
It is recommended to use a linter tool such as `ruff` to check code before submitting 
a pull request. A `pre-commit` configuration for `ruff` has been included for ease of 
use.
