# AiiDA-ChemShell Plugin Test Suite 

This plugin supports testing via pytest. To be able to run the calculation job tests you will need to 
ensure the chemsh.x executable is available in the environment PATH and that it has been configured to run 
NWChem, DL_POLY and GULP either directly or as external codes.
